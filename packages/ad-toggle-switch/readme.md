switch track border radius is set as 28px instead of 50% to make it look like a pill shape. This is because the track is a rectangle and not a circle. If you want to change the border radius, you can do so by overriding the CSS variable `--ad-toggle-switch-track-border-radius` in your CSS file.

`--ad-sys-color-surface-container-highest` is not working so use palette color instead i.e `--ad-ref-palette-neutral90`

Future updates remaining for this component.
